## CBT Records

### CBT Records is an online vinyl record store and electronic music label that hopes to create a direct connection between collectors and artists in the electronic music scene worldwide. It's aim is to market new music, events, merchandise and records sales, both online and in mockup physical stores. It's revenue would be generated via traffic to the artists direct sites.

### The site will be targeted towards artists, labels, djs & collectors, who are looking for one single place to discover, purchase, sell and promote music from. It will have one login, one shipping cost and will host a thriving online community. The site will also be a platform for creatives to share ideas, resources, events, tips, reviews and more.

## Features left to implement

## *Merch page*

### This page would allow a user to browse different merchandise available from artists and labels, with links to connect with the direct store.

## Another feature idea

## *Forum*

### This section would act as an online forum for site users to discuss releases, events, concepts and more.

## Testing
### In testing the site, I first ensured the heading nav bar was fully functional with the logo and all three pages navigating with the same style applied. I ensured the landing page zoom style works on launch. I went through each google map anchor in the physical locations section divs, which successfully launch in a new tab when selected. In the Browse page I tested each linked label image, which succesfully launches the label/artists site directly in a new tab. Lastly I tested the Join page, validating each input of the form and submitting with a succesful result.

### The project has also been tested to be responsive on tablet and mobile devices using developer tools.

## Validator Testing

## HTML
### No errors on HTML on all pages were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.
### 5 warnings are noted on index.html. This is due to the icons placed above the physical location text in the div. To maintain size and style, I added the icons within h2 elements. No additional text was required.
### 1 warning was noted on browse.html for not having a header in my section. However this was a personal choice.

## CSS
### No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

## Deployment
### The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
* From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
* Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
* The live link can be found here - https://grego44.github.io/cbt-records/
